# Welcome!

If you're thinking of contributing to Up Your A11y - thank you so much! I'd love to have your contribution, whether it's your first pull request or your thousandth.

Before you get started with a contribution, here's a few things you might need to know and some best practice guidelines.

## Getting started with the repo

Up Your A11y is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) app. If you've never used Gatsby before - don't worry! You probably don't need to know much about it (if anything) to make most contributions here. 

Once you've forked the repo and pulled it down, you'll need to run:

- `npm install` to set up the packages
- `gatsby develop` to run the app

Once running, you should be able to see it in your browser at localhost:8000.

## Logging an issue

Have you noticed something in Up Your A11y that's not quite right? I'd love it if you created an issue if so! As a general guide, your issue should include:

- Steps to reproduce the failure
- Information on which browser / device you observed the failure on
- If you have a suggested fix in mind, or are interested in creating a PR to fix it, please add this info too

Please do ensure that you check current open issues first to make sure you're not duplicating.

## Picking up an issue

If you'd like to contribute, take a look at current open issues in the repo. To make sure effort isn't duplicated, I'd suggest commenting on the issue first to let people know you'd like to take it on.

Some issues are labelled as "Needs refinement" - these are placeholders and not ready to be worked on yet. The "Help wanted" and "Good first issue" labels mark out issues that might be best to pick up if you're new to the repo.

Up Your A11y is new to receiving open source contributions, so please bear with me if some of the issue descriptions are not clear! I'll be happy to answer any questions you have and work with you to define the piece of work and help you get staretd with your first contribution.

## Submitting a pull request

Once you're ready to submit your pull request, please remember to note in the description the issue number it addresses. Netlify will automatically start creating a build when your open your pull request - once it has built, I strongly suggest checking out the the test build and making sure it all works as you expect.
