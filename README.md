[Up Your A11y](https://www.upyoura11y.com) is a web accessibility toolkit, full of tutorials and information to help developers make sure their web apps can be used and understood by as wide a range of users as possible.

The site is created and maintained by me - Suzanne - a software developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Feel free to reach out with any questions or content suggestions either via the website's contact form or on Twitter ([@s_aitchison](https://twitter.com/s_aitchison))

## Contributing

I'm currently working on a re-design for the site, and hoping to take a more open source approach to Up Your A11y once this is complete. I'd love to have your help in future, so look out for the 'help wanted' label starting to appear on issues soon!

### Running the code

Up your A11y is built in [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), with tutorials written in MDX. To run the code:

- Download the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `gatsby develop`
- the site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`
