# Welcome!

How do you find reading the content on this page with your screen reader?

And when you landed on the page, where was the current focus?

Does tabbing to the link back to the article work as you expected?

<Link to="/handling-focus">Go back to article</Link>

Depending on your browser and screen reader combination, you might have observed slightly different behaviour, but it's likely that the title of the page wasn't announced to you, and your keyboard focus is still lingering on something that's now disappeared from the page!
